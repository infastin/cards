If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright 2019 Google LLC\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

    "version": "0.3.2",
    "licenseText": "# @expo/cli\n\nThe `@expo/cli` package is a CLI binary that should be used via `expo` like `npx expo start`.\n\n```\nnpx expo\n```\n\n## Design\n\nThis CLI has the following purposes:\n\n- Be a minimal interface for starting a local development server that emulates a production EAS Updates server. The development server is the proxy between a native runtime (Expo Go, Dev Client) and a JS Bundler (Metro, Webpack).\n  - To accomplish secure manifest signing (think https/TSL/SSL for web (required for sandboxing AsyncStorage, Permissions, etc.)) we need an authenticated Expo user account. This is the only reason we include the authentication commands `login`, `logout`, `whoami`, `register`. Standard web CLIs don't have authentication commands because they either don't setup https or they use emulation via packages like `devcert`.\n- Orchestrating various native tools like Xcode, Simulator.app, Android Studio, ADB, etc. to make native builds as painless as possible. `run:ios`, `run:android` commands.\n- Implementing a versioned `prebuild` command that can reliably work with a project for long periods of time. Prebuild is like a bundler for native code, it generates the `ios`, `android` folders based on the project Expo config (`app.json`).\n  - `npx expo config` is auxiliary to `npx expo prebuild` and used for debugging/introspection.\n- Installing versioned libraries with `npx expo install` this is a minimal utility born out of pure necessity since versioning in React Native is hard to get right.\n\n# Contributing\n\nTo develop the CLI run (defaults to watch mode):\n\n```\nyarn build\n```\n\nWe highly recommend setting up an alias for the Expo CLI so you can try it in projects all around your computer. Open your `.zshrc` or other config file and add:\n\n```\nalias nexpo=\"/path/to/expo/packages/@expo/cli/build/bin/cli\"\n```\n\nThen use it with `nexpo` like `nexpo config`. You can also setup a debug version:\n\n```\nalias expo-inspect=\"node --inspect /path/to/expo/packages/@expo/cli/build/bin/cli\"\n```\n\nThen you can run it, and visit `chrome://inspect/#devices` in Chrome, and press \"Open dedicated DevTools for Node\" to get a debugger attached to your process. When debugging the CLI, you'll want to disable workers whenever possible, this will make all code run on the same thread, this is mostly applicable to the `start` command, i.e. `expo-inspect start --max-workers 0`.\n\n## Format\n\n- Be sure to update the [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) with changes for every PR. You only need to add the message, our GitHub bot will automatically suggest adding your name and PR number to the diff.\n- End `async` functions with `Async` like `runAsync`. This is just how we format functions at Expo.\n- When throwing errors, always opt for `CommandError` instead of `Error` -- this helps with debugging and making the experience feel more coherent.\n- Utilize the unified `Log` module instead of `console.log`.\n- When logging with variables, utilize the following format `Something happened (foo: bar, baz: foz)`.\n  - Avoid other formats like `Something happened: bar, foz` or `Something happened: foo=bar, baz=foz`.\n- Main UI components like command names (`expo start`), arguments (`--port`), and `--help` messages should be modified internally, by the Expo team to ensure the developer experience is unified across Expo tooling. External contributions modifying these core aspects may be rejected.\n- Use the `profile` utility method with the `EXPO_PROFILE=1` environment variable to measure execution time.\n- Avoid globals and singletons as these make testing harder and less predictable. The only global we have (at the time of writing this) is the `isOffline` boolean.\n\n## Environment\n\n- Always be cautious of the transitive size of dependencies. [packagephobia](https://packagephobia.now.sh/) is a great resource for determining if a package is lean. Try to minimize adding dependencies to the CLI.\n- We build the CLI using `taskr` + `swc`, this is partially inspired by Next.js' local CLI.\n- The build pipeline will inline the CLI version as an environment variable that is accessible anywhere in the CLI codebase. You can access it via `process.env.__EXPO_VERSION` instead of reading the local `package.json` at runtime.\n- Unlike the legacy global Expo CLI, this CLI is shipped with `expo` meaning the SDK Version is always present.\n  - Reduce SDK specific tasks since only one SDK should be accounted for in a single version of `@expo/cli`.\n  - The `@expo/config` method `getConfig` does not need the `skipSDKVersionRequirement` in any case since `expo` should always be installed. Ex: `getConfig('...', { skipSDKVersionRequirement: true });` shouldn't be used.\n- Also unlike the global Expo CLI we can assume that node modules are always installed since this CLI should be used via a project's local `node_modules` folder.\n  - This means we can't perform operations that upgrade the `expo` package as these may kill the running process. Features that need this pattern (like `expo upgrade`) should live in standalone global tools.\n\n## Testing\n\nThere are two testing scripts:\n\n- `yarn test`: Controlled unit and integration tests.\n- `yarn test:e2e`: End to end testing for CLI commands. This requires the files be built with `yarn build`\n\n---\n\n- You can target a specific set of tests with the `--watch` flag. Example: `yarn test --watch config`.\n- We use back ticks for `it` blocks. Example <code>it(`works`)</code>.\n- If a pull request is fully self contained to the `packages/@expo/cli/` folder (i.e. no `yarn.lock` modifications, etc.) then most native CI tests will be skipped, making CI pass faster in PRs.\n\n### Unit Testing Guidelines\n\n- Use `nock` for network requests.\n- No top level `describe` blocks that wrap all the tests in a file.\n- When testing a function, pass the function to the describe instead of a stringified function name:\n  - `describe(foobar, () => {})` instead of `describe('foobar', () => {})`\n- Use virtual `fs` via `memfs` whenever possible.\n- We have a lot of global module [**mocks**](./e2e/setup.ts) already in place, consider them when writing tests.\n- GitHub Copilot can make writing tests a little less tedious.\n\n### E2E Testing Guidelines\n\n- E2E tests should be resilient and reliable, be sure to give them plenty of time for network requests.\n- When testing locally you should attempt to reuse node modules for faster results. In the `npx expo prebuild` and `npx expo start` commands for instance, we utilize a helper method that will default to reusing a project + node_modules when run locally. This can be [toggled off](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/11a5a4d27b7e1c8e4d6ddf0401397d789d89f52a/packages/%40expo/cli/e2e/__tests__/utils.ts#L174) to bootstrap a fresh project every time.\n- When bootstrapping test projects, utilize the temporary folder `os.tmpdir()` as this folder is automatically cleaned up when the computer restarts.\n\n## Coming from Expo CLI\n\n> TL;DR: `expo-cli` was 'make it work', whereas `@expo/cli` is 'make it right, make it fast'.\n\nThe legacy global `expo-cli` package was deprecated in favor of this versioned `@expo/cli` package for the following reasons:\n\n- `expo-cli` was too big and took way too long to install. This made CI frustrating to setup since you needed to also target global node modules for caching.\n- `expo-cli` worked for almost all versions of the `expo` package, meaning it was getting more complex with every release.\n- `expo-cli` combined service commands (like the legacy `build`, `submit`, `publish`) with project-level commands like `expo start`. We've since divided services into `eas-cli` and project commands into `npx expo` (`@expo/cli`). This structure is more optimal/faster for developers since they can install/update commands when they need them.\n- This CLI utilizes more Node.js standard features like `$EDITOR` instead of the custom `$EXPO_EDITOR` environment variable. Also transitioning away from `$EXPO_DEBUG` and more towards `$DEBUG=expo:*`. These types of changes make Expo CLI play nicer with existing tooling.\n- The DevTools UI has been deprecated to reduce the net install size, minimize complexity, and make room for future debugging UIs (Hermes/v8 Chrome debugger).\n- The `expo start:web` and `expo web` commands have been rolled into `npx expo start` as we now lazily load platforms until the device requests them.\n- Other missing or beta features from `expo-cli` may still be getting migrated over to this new CLI. For a more comprehensive breakdown see the [start command PR](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/16160)."

    "version": "1.0.0",
    "licenseText": "# expo/devcert\n\nA fork of `devcert` with bundle size optimizations.\n\n# devcert - Development SSL made easy\n\nSo, running a local HTTPS server usually sucks. There's a range of\napproaches, each with their own tradeoff. The common one, using self-signed\ncertificates, means having to ignore scary browser warnings for each project.\n\ndevcert makes the process easy. Want a private key and certificate file to\nuse with your server? Just ask:\n\n```js\nlet ssl = await devcert.certificateFor(\"my-app.test\");\nhttps.createServer(ssl, app).listen(3000);\n```\n\nNow open https://my-app.test:3000 and voila - your page loads with no scary\nwarnings or hoops to jump through.\n\n> Certificates are cached by name, so two calls for\n> `certificateFor('foo')` will return the same key and certificate.\n\n## Options\n\nWhen it installs or upgrades, devcert creates a self-signed certificate\nauthority (CA) which it uses to sign all certificates it creates. It will try\nto register this CA with OS keychains in OSX, Linux, and Windows. However,\nsome HTTP clients (such as Firefox and NodeJS itself) use their own trusted\ncertificate list instead of the operating system's keychain. The `getCaPath`\nand `getCaBuffer` options make the CA available in the `certificateFor()`\nreturn object itself, so that these programs can choose whether to trust it.\n\n### getCaPath\n\nSet this option to `true` and the returned object will inlude a `caPath`\nproperty, set to the file path of the certificate authority file. Use this\npath to add the certificate to local trust stores which accept paths as\narguments, such as NodeJS's builtin environment variable\n`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`..\n\n### getCaBuffer\n\nSet this option to `true` and the returned object will inlude a `ca`\nproperty, set to the UTF-8-encoded contents of the certificate authority\nfile. Use this path to add the certificate to local trust stores which don't\nuse OS settings, lke the examples mentioned above.\n\n### skipHostsFile\n\nIf you supply a custom domain name (i.e. any domain other than `localhost`)\nwhen requesting a certificate from devcert, it will attempt to modify your\nsystem to redirect requests for that domain to your local machine (rather\nthan to the real domain). It does this by modifying your `/etc/hosts` file.\n\nIf you pass in the `skipHostsFile` option, devcert will skip this step. This\nmeans that if you ask for certificates for `my-app.test` (for example), and\ndon't have some other DNS redirect method in place, that you won't be able to\naccess your app at `https://my-app.test` because your computer wouldn't know\nthat `my-app.test` should resolve your local machine.\n\nKeep in mind that SSL certificates are issued for _domains_, so if you ask\nfor a certificate for `my-app.test`, and don't have any kind of DNS redirect\nin place (`/etc/hosts` or otherwise), trying to hit `localhost` won't work,\neven if the app you intended to serve via `my-app.test` is running on your\nlocal machine (since the SSL certificate won't say `localhost`).\n\n### skipCertutil\n\nThis option will tell devcert to avoid installing `certutil` tooling.\n\n`certutil` is a tooling package used to automated the installation of SSL\ncertificates in certain circumstances; specifically, Firefox (for every OS)\nand Chrome (on Linux only).\n\nNormally, devcert will attempt to install `certutil` if it's need and not\nalready present on your system. If don't want devcert to install this\npackage, pass `skipCertutil: true`.\n\nIf you decide to `skipCertutil`, the initial setup process for devcert\nchanges in these two scenarios:\n\n- **Firefox on all platforms**: Thankully, Firefox makes this easy. There's a\n  point-and-click wizard for importing and trusting a certificate, so if you\n  specify `skipCertutil: true`, devcert will instead automatically open Firefox\n  and kick off this wizard for you. Simply follow the prompts to trust the\n  certificate. **Reminder: you'll only need to do this once per machine**\n\n- **Chrome on Linux**: Unfortunately, it appears that the **only** way to get\n  Chrome to trust an SSL certificate on Linux is via the `certutil` tooling -\n  there is no manual process for it. Thus, if you are using Chrome on Linux, do\n  **not** supply `skipCertuil: true`. If you do, devcert certificates will not\n  be trusted by Chrome.\n\nThe `certutil` tooling is installed in OS-specific ways:\n\n- Mac: `brew install nss`\n- Linux: `apt install libnss3-tools`\n- Windows: N/A (there is no easy, hands-off way to install certutil on Windows,\n  so devcert will simply fallback to the wizard approach for Firefox outlined\n  above)\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen you ask for a development certificate, devcert will first check to see\nif it has run on this machine before. If not, it will create a root\ncertificate authority and add it to your OS and various browser trust stores.\nYou'll likely see password prompts from your OS at this point to authorize\nthe new root CA.\n\nSince your machine now trusts this root CA, it will trust any certificates\nsigned by it. So when you ask for a certificate for a new domain, devcert\nwill use the root CA credentials to generate a certificate specific to the\ndomain you requested, and returns the new certificate to you.\n\nIf you request a domain that has already had certificates generated for it,\ndevcert will simply return the cached certificates.\n\nThis setup ensures that browsers won't show scary warnings about untrusted\ncertificates, since your OS and browsers will now trust devcert's\ncertificates.\n\n## Security Concerns\n\nThere's a reason that your OS prompts you for your root password when devcert\nattempts to install it's root certificate authority. By adding it to your\nmachine's trust stores, your browsers will automatically trust _any_ certificate\ngenerated with it.\n\nThis exposes a potential attack vector on your local machine: if someone else\ncould use the devcert certificate authority to generate certificates, and if\nthey could intercept / manipulate your network traffic, they could theoretically\nimpersonate some websites, and your browser would not show any warnings (because\nit trusts the devcert authority).\n\nTo prevent this, devcert takes steps to ensure that no one can access the\ndevcert certificate authority credentials to generate malicious certificates\nwithout you knowing. The exact approach varies by platform:\n\n- **macOS and Linux**: the certificate authority's credentials are written to files that are only readable by the root user (i.e. `chown 0 ca-cert.crt` and\n  `chmod 600 ca-cert.crt`). When devcert itself needs these, it shells out to\n  `sudo` invocations to read / write the credentials.\n- **Windows**: because of my unfamiliarity with Windows file permissions, I\n  wasn't confident I would be able to correctly set permissions to mimic the setup\n  on macOS and Linux. So instead, devcert will prompt you for a password, and then\n  use that to encrypt the credentials with an AES256 cipher. The password is never\n  written to disk.\n\nTo further protect these credentials, any time they are written to disk, they\nare written to temporary files, and are immediately deleted after they are no longer needed.\n\nAdditionally, the root CA certificate is unique to your machine only: it's\ngenerated on-the-fly when it is first installed. ensuring there are no\ncentral / shared keys to crack across machines.\n\n### Why install a root certificate authority at all?\n\nThe root certificate authority makes it simpler to manage which domains are\nconfigured for SSL by devcert. The alternative is to generate and trust\nself-signed certificates for each domain. The problem is that while devcert\nis able to add a certificate to your machine's trust stores, the tooling to\nremove a certificate doesn't cover every case. So if you ever wanted to\n_untrust_ devcert's certificates, you'd have to manually remove each one from\neach trust store.\n\nBy trusting only a single root CA, devcert is able to guarantee that when you\nwant to _disable_ SSL for a domain, it can do so with no manual intervention\n\n- we just delete the domain-specific certificate files. Since these\n  domain-specific files aren't installed in your trust stores, once they are\n  gone, they are gone.\n\n## Integration\n\ndevcert has been designed from day one to work as low-level library that other\ntools can delegate to. The goal is to make HTTPS development easy for everyone,\nregardless of framework or library choice.\n\nWith that in mind, if you'd like to use devcert in your library/framework/CLI,\ndevcert makes that easy.\n\nIn addition to the options above, devcert exposes a `ui` option. This option\nallows you to control all the points where devcert requries user interaction,\nsubstituting your own prompts and user interface. You can use this to brand\nthe experience with your own tool's name, localize the messages, or integrate\ndevcert into a larger existing workflow.\n\nThe `ui` option should be an object with the following methods:\n\n```ts\n{\n  async getWindowsEncryptionPassword(): Promise<string> {\n    // Invoked when devcert needs the password used to encrypt the root\n    // certificate authority credentials on Windows. May be invoked multiple\n    // times if the user's supplied password is incorrect\n  },\n  async warnChromeOnLinuxWithoutCertutil(): Promise<string> {\n    // Invoked when devcert is run on Linux, detects that Chrome is installed,\n    // and the `skipCertutil` option is `true`. Used to warn the user that\n    // Chrome will not work with `skipCertutil: true` on Linux.\n  },\n  async closeFirefoxBeforeContinuing() {\n    // Invoked when devcert detects that Firefox is running while it is trying\n    // to programmatically install it's certificate authority in the Firefox\n    // trust store. Firefox appears to overwrite changes to the trust store on\n    // exit, so Firefox must be closed before devcert can continue. devcert will\n    // wait for Firefox to exit - this is just to prompt the user that they\n    // need to close the application.\n  },\n  async startFirefoxWizard(certificateHost: string) {\n    // Invoked when devcert detects a Firefox installation and `skipCertutil:\n    // true` was specified. This is invoked right before devcert launches the\n    // Firefox certificate import wizard GUI. Used to give the user a heads up\n    // as to why they are about to see Firefox pop up.\n    //\n    // The certificateHost provided is the URL for the temporary server that\n    // devcert has spun up in order to trigger the wizard(Firefox needs try to\n    // \"download\" the cert to trigger the wizard). This URL will load the page\n    // supplied in the `firefoxWizardPromptPage()` method below.\n    //\n    // Normally, devcert will automatically open this URL, but in case it fails\n    // you may want to print it out to the console with an explanatory message\n    // so the user isn't left hanging wondering what's happening.\n  },\n  async firefoxWizardPromptPage(certificateURL: string): Promise<string> {\n    // When devcert starts the Firefox certificate installation wizard GUI, it\n    // first loads an HTML page in Firefox. The template used for that page is\n    // the return value of this method. The supplied certificateURL is the path\n    // to the actual certificate. The Firefox tab must attempt to load this URL\n    // to trigger the wizard.\n    //\n    // The default implemenation is a simple redirect to that URL. But you could\n    // supply your own branded template here, with a button that says \"Install\n    // certificate\" that is linked to the certificateURL, along with a more in\n    // depth explanation of what is happening for example.\n  }\n  async waitForFirefoxWizard() {\n    // Invoked _after_ the Firefox certificate import wizard is kicked off. This\n    // method should not resolve until the user indicates that the wizard is\n    // complete (unfortunately, we have no way of determining that\n    // programmatically)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can supply any or all of these methods - ones you do not supply will fall\nback to the default implemenation.\n\n## Testing\n\nTesting a tool like devcert can be a pain. I haven't found a good automated\nsolution for cross platform GUI testing (the GUI part is necessary to test\neach browser's handling of devcert certificates, as well as test the Firefox\nwizard flow).\n\nTo make things easier, devcert comes with a series of virtual machine images. Each one is a snapshot taken right before running a test - just launch the machine and hit <Enter>.\n\nYou can also use the snapshotted state of the VMs to roll them back to a\npristine state for another round of testing.\n\n> **Note**: Be aware that the macOS license terms prohibit running it on\n> non-Apple hardware, so you must own a Mac to test that platform. If you don't\n> own a Mac - that's okay, just mention in the PR that you were unable to test\n> on a Mac and we're happy to test it for you.\n\n### Virtual Machine Snapshots\n\n- [macOS](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/devcert-test-snapshots/macOS.pvm.zip)\n- [Windows](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/devcert-test-snapshots/MSEdge+-+Win10.zip)\n- [Ubuntu](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/devcert-test-snapshots/Ubuntu+Linux.zip)\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Dave Wasmer](http://davewasmer.com)"

Re-rendering of components when objects in the database change requires manually adding and removing listeners, which produce a lot of boilerplate code and is error-prone (if listeners properly removed on unmount). This library alleviates that by providing [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) which return Realm data that is state aware. As a consequence, any change to the Realm data will cause components using the hook to re-render.\n\nDocumentation for `@realm/react` and Realm can be found at [docs.mongodb.org](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/react-native/use-realm-react/).\n## Installation\n\nThis library requires `react-native` >= 0.59 and `realm` >= 10\n\nnpm:\n\n```\nnpm install realm @realm/react\n```\n\nyarn:\n\n```\nyarn add realm @realm/react\n```\n\n## Try it out\n\nHere is a simple task manager application written with Realm React.  Copy into a React Native application and give it a try!\n\n```tsx\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { SafeAreaView, View, Text, TextInput, FlatList, Pressable } from \"react-native\";\nimport { Realm, createRealmContext } from '@realm/react'\nclass Task extends Realm.Object {\n  _id!: Realm.BSON.ObjectId;\n  description!: string;\n  isComplete!: boolean;\n  createdAt!: Date;\n\n  static generate(description: string) {\n    return {\n      _id: new Realm.BSON.ObjectId(),\n      description,\n      createdAt: new Date(),\n    };\n  }\n\n  static schema = {\n    name: 'Task',\n    primaryKey: '_id',\n    properties: {\n      _id: 'objectId',\n      description: 'string',\n      isComplete: { type: 'bool', default: false },\n      createdAt: 'date'\n    },\n  };\n}\n\nconst { RealmProvider, useRealm, useQuery } = createRealmContext({ schema: [Task] })\n\nexport default function AppWrapper() {\n  return (\n    <RealmProvider><TaskApp /></RealmProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction TaskApp() {\n  const realm = useRealm();\n  const tasks = useQuery(Task);\n  const [newDescription, setNewDescription] = useState(\"\")\n\n  return (\n    <SafeAreaView>\n      <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', justifyContent: 'center', margin: 10 }}>\n        <TextInput\n          value={newDescription}\n          placeholder=\"Enter new task description\"\n          onChangeText={setNewDescription}\n        />\n        <Pressable\n          onPress={() => {\n            realm.write(() => {\n              realm.create(\"Task\", Task.generate(newDescription));\n            });\n            setNewDescription(\"\")\n          }}><Text>➕</Text></Pressable>\n      </View>\n      <FlatList data={tasks.sorted(\"createdAt\")} keyExtractor={(item) => item._id.toHexString()} renderItem={({ item }) => {\n        return (\n          <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', justifyContent: 'center', margin: 10 }}>\n            <Pressable\n              onPress={() =>\n                realm.write(() => {\n                  item.isComplete = !item.isComplete\n                })\n              }><Text>{item.isComplete ? \"✅\" : \"☑️\"}</Text></Pressable>\n            <Text style={{ paddingHorizontal: 10 }} >{item.description}</Text>\n            <Pressable\n              onPress={() => {\n                realm.write(() => {\n                  realm.delete(item)\n                })\n              }} ><Text>{\"🗑️\"}</Text></Pressable>\n          </View>\n        );\n      }} ></FlatList>\n    </SafeAreaView >\n  );\n}\n```\n\nFor a full fledged example, check out [our templates](https://github.com/realm/realm-js#template-apps-using-expo-for-react-native).\n\n## Realm Hooks\n\n### useRealm\nReturns the instance of the [`Realm`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/js/latest/Realm.html) configured by `createRealmContext` and the `RealmProvider`.  The following is an example of how to use this Hook to make a write transaction callback for a component.\n\n```tsx\n// assume props contain item a Realm.Object\nconst Component = ({item}) => {\n  const realm = useRealm();\n  const toggleComplete = useCallback((item) => {\n    realm.write(() => {\n      item.isComplete = !item.isComplete\n    })\n  },[item, realm])\n\n  return (\n    <Pressable\n      onPress={() =>\n        realm.write(() => {\n          item.isComplete = !item.isComplete\n        })\n      }><Text>{item.isComplete ? \"✅\" : \"☑️\"}</Text>\n    </Pressable>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### useQuery\n\nReturns [`Realm.Results`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/js/latest/Realm.Results.html) from a given type. This Hook will update on any changes to any Object in the Collection and return an empty array if the Collection is empty.\nThe result of this can be consumed directly by the `data` argument of any React Native [`VirtualizedList`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/virtualizedlist) or [`FlatList`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist).  If the component used for the list's `renderItem` prop is wrapped with [`React.Memo`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo), then only the modified object will re-render.\n\n```tsx\nconst Component = () => {\n  // ObjectClass is a class extending Realm.Object, which should have been provided in the Realm Config.\n  // It is also possible to use the model's name as a string ( ex. \"Object\" ) if you are not using class based models.\n  const collection = useQuery(ObjectClass);\n\n  // The methods `sorted` and `filtered` should be wrapped in a useMemo.\n  const sortedCollection = useMemo(() => collection.sorted(), [collection]);\n\n  return (\n    <FlatList data={sortedCollection} renderItem={({ item }) => <Object item={item}/>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### useObject\n Returns a [`Realm.Object`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/js/latest/Realm.Object.html) for a given type and primary key.  The Hook will update on any changes to the properties on the returned Object and return `null` if it either doesn't exist or has been deleted.\n\n```tsx\nconst Component = ({someId}) => {\n  // ObjectClass is a class extending Realm.Object, which should have been provided in the Realm Config.\n  // It is also possible to use the model's name as a string ( ex. \"Object\" ) if you are not using class based models.\n  const object = useObject(ObjectClass, someId);\n\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <Text>{object.name}</Text>\n    </View>\n  )\n}\n```\n## Setting Things Up\n### createRealmContext\n\nTo get started with `@realm/react`, one must create a Context object with `createRealmContext`.  The Context object will contain a Realm Context Provider, which will have an open Realm as its context, and a set of Hooks that access the Realm Context.\n\nThe structure of the Context object is:\n\n```\n{\n  RealmProvider, // Wrapper for your application to enable usage of hooks\n  useRealm, // Hook to access the configured Realm\n  useQuery, // Hook to access collections of Realm objects\n  useObject, // Hook to access a single Realm object by primary key\n}\n```\n\nThe configuration for the Realm context can be given as an object argument to `createRealmContext` or be set directly on the `RealmProvider` props. The props set on `RealmProvider` will be merged with those provided to `createRealmContext`, with the props taking priority.  A Realm will be opened with this merged configuration when the Realm Context Provider is rendered.  A fallback component can optionally be rendered until the Realm is opened.  This is useful for projects using Realm Sync.\n\nHere is an example of how to setup Realm React with a Task model:\n\n```tsx\nimport {createRealmContext} from '@realm/react';\n\nconst myRealmConfig = { schema: [Task, User, /*...*/]};\n\nconst { RealmProvider, useRealm, useObject, useQuery } = createRealmContext(myRealmConfig);\n\nconst AppWrapper = () => {\n  return (\n    <RealmProvider>\n      <App/>\n    <RealmProvider>\n  )\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Multiple Realms\n`createRealmContext` can be called multiple times if your app requires more than one Realm.  In that case, you would have multiple `RealmProvider`s that wrap your app and must use the hooks from the context you wish to access.\n\n```tsx\nconst { RealmProvider: PublicRealmProvider, useRealm: usePublicRealm, useObject: usePublicObject, useQuery: usePublicQuery } = createRealmContext(publicConfig);\nconst { RealmProvider: PrivateRealmProvider, useRealm: usePrivateRealm, useObject: usePrivateObject, useQuery: usePrivateQuery } = createRealmContext(privateConfig);\n```\n\nIt is also possible to call it without any Config; in the case that you want to do all your configuration through the `RealmProvider` props.\n### RealmProvider\n\nIn the example above, we used the `RealmProvider` without any props.  It is, however, possible to configure the Realm through props on the `RealmProvider`.\n\n```tsx\nconst AppWrapper = () => {\n  return (\n    <RealmProvider schema={[Task, User, /*...*/]} onFirstOpen={(realm) => {/*initialize realm with some data*/}}>\n      <App/>\n    <RealmProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `RealmProvider` also comes with a fallback prop that can be used for sync conifigurations.  It can take time for larger datasets to sync, especially if it's the first time.  In that case, it is recommended to provide a loading component as a fallback.\n\n```tsx\nconst AppWrapper = () => {\n  return (\n    <RealmProvider fallback={<Loading/>} >\n      <App/>\n    <RealmProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to access the configured Realm from outside of the `RealmProvider`, for instance, implementing a client reset fallback.  This can be done by creating a `ref` with `useRef` and setting the `realmRef` property of `RealmProvider`.\n\n```tsx\nconst AppWrapper = () => {\n  const realmRef = useRef<Realm|null>(null)\n\n  return (\n    <RealmProvider realmRef={realmRef}>\n      <App/>\n    <RealmProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n### Dynamically Updating a Realm Configuration\n\nIt is possible to update the realm configuration by setting props on the `RealmProvider`.  The `RealmProvider` takes props for all possible realm configuration properties.\n\nFor example, one could setup the sync configuration based on a user state:\n\n```tsx\nconst [user, setUser] = useState()\n\n//... some logic to get user state\n\n<RealmProvider sync={{ user, partition }}>\n```\n\n### `useApp` and the `AppProvider`\n\nThe `useApp` hook can be used to access your Realm App instance as long as the `AppProvider` wraps your application.  This should be done outside of your `RealmProvider`.\n\n`AppProvider` usage:\n\n```tsx\nimport { AppProvider } from '@realm/react'\n//...\n// Wrap your RealmProvider with the AppProvider and provide an appId\n<AppProvider id={appId}>\n\t<RealmProvider sync={{user, flexible: true}}>\n\t//...\n\t</RealmProvider>\n</AppProvider>\n```\n\n`useApp` usage:\n```tsx\n// Access the app instance using the useApp hook\nimport { useApp } from '@realm/react'\n\nconst SomeComponent = () => {\n\tconst app = useApp();\n\n\t//...\n}\n```\n\nIt is also possible to receive a reference to the app outside of the `AppProvider`, through the `appRef` property.  This must be set to a React reference returned from `useRef`.\n\n```tsx\nconst AppWrapper = () => {\n  const appRef = useRef<Realm.App|null>(null)\n\n  return (\n    <AppProvider appRef={appRef}>\n      <App/>\n    <AppProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### `useUser` and the `UserProvider`\n\nWith the introduction of the `UserProvider`, the `user` can be automatically populated into the underlying Realm configuration.  The `fallback` property can be used to provide a login component.\nThe child components will be rendered as soon as a user has authenticated.  On logout, the fallback will be displayed again.\n\n`UserProvider` usage:\n\n```tsx\nimport { AppProvider, UserProvider } from '@realm/react'\n//...\n<AppProvider id={appId}>\n\t<UserProvider fallback={LoginComponent}>\n\t\t{/* After login, user will be automatically populated in realm configuration */}\n\t\t<RealmProvider sync={{flexible: true}}>\n\t\t//...\n\t\t</RealmProvider>\n\t</UserProvider>\n</AppProvider>\n```\n\n`useUser` usage:\n```tsx\n// Access the app instance using the useApp hook\nimport { useUser } from '@realm/react'\n\nconst SomeComponent = () => {\n\tconst user = useUser();\n\n\t//...\n}\n```"

It will either trim the results or add necessary amount of spaces. The `bias` control if trimming/padding should be done at the start of the string representing built children or at the end.\n\n```js\nfixed(5, 'start', 'ERR'); // => '  ERR'\nfixed(8, 'end', color('green', 'success')); // equals to color('green', 'success') + ' '\nfixed(10, 'end', 'Hello', pad(2), 'World') // => 'Hello  Wor'\n```\n\n#### `ifElse`\n\n```ts\nifElse(\n  condition: Condition,\n  ifTrueFragment: string | IFragment,\n  elseFragment: string | IFragment\n): IFragment\n\ntype ConditionValue = boolean | string | number | null | undefined;\ntype Condition = ConditionValue | (() => ConditionValue);\n```\n\nChange the output based on condition. Condition can ba a primitive value, which can be casted to boolean or a function. If conation or return value of condition is evaluated to `true`, the first argument - `ifTrueFragment` will be used, otherwise `elseFragment`.\n\n```js\nlet condition = getConditionValue()\nifElse(\n  () => condition,\n  color('red', 'ERROR'),\n  color('yellow', 'WARNING')\n)\n```\n\n#### `provide`\n\n```ts\nprovide<T>(\n  value: T,\n  builder: (value: T) => string | IFragment\n): IFragment\n```\n\nProvides given value to a builder function, which should return `string` or fragment. Useful in situations when the output is connected with some calculated value - using `provide` you only need to calculate final value once and forward it to custom styling logic.\n\n```js\nprovide(getMessageFromSomewhere(), value => {\n  switch (value.level) {\n    case 'error':\n      return container(\n        color('red', modifier('bold', value.level.toUpperCase())),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    case 'info':\n      return container(\n        color('blue', value.level.toUpperCase()),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    default:\n      return container(value.level.toUpperCase(), pad(2), value.log);\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n<!-- badges (common) -->\n\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[prs-welcome-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[prs-welcome]: http://makeapullrequest.com\n[coc-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20of-conduct-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square\n[coc]: https://github.com/zamotany/ansi-fragments/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-discord-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square&colorB=7289DA&logo=discord\n[chat]: https://discord.gg/zwR2Cdh\n\n[version]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-fragments"

    "licenseText": "# assert-plus\n\nThis library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two\nthings: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable\nNODE\\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like\n`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n```javascript\n    var assert = require('assert-plus');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n        assert.object(options, 'options');\n        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');\n        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');\n        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');\n        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');\n        assert.func(callback, 'callback');\n\n        // Do stuff\n        callback(null, {});\n    }\n```\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.string(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n```javascript\n    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');\n```\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are\nalso disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from\nthe `assert` module avoids this behavior.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.array\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.finite\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.stream\n* assert.date\n* assert.regexp\n* assert.uuid\n* assert.arrayOfArray\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfBuffer\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfFinite\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.arrayOfStream\n* assert.arrayOfDate\n* assert.arrayOfRegexp\n* assert.arrayOfUuid\n* assert.optionalArray\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalFinite\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalStream\n* assert.optionalDate\n* assert.optionalRegexp\n* assert.optionalUuid\n* assert.optionalArrayOfArray\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFinite\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfStream\n* assert.optionalArrayOfDate\n* assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp\n* assert.optionalArrayOfUuid\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "repository": "https://github.com/expo/expo",
    "name": "babel-preset-expo",
    "version": "9.2.0",
    "licenseText": "# babel-preset-expo\n\nThis preset extends the default React Native preset (`metro-react-native-babel-preset`) and adds support for decorators, tree-shaking web packages, and loading font icons with optional native dependencies if they're installed.\n\nYou can use this preset in any React Native project as a drop-in replacement for `metro-react-native-babel-preset`. If your project isn't using native font loading or web support then this preset will only add support for decorators with `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` - this is mostly used for supporting legacy community libraries.\n\nIf you start your **web** project with `@expo/webpack-config` or `expo start:web` and your project doesn't contain a `babel.config.js` or a `.babelrc` then it will default to using `babel-preset-expo` for loading.\n\nIf you have problems with the code in this repository, please file issues & bug reports\nat https://github.com/expo/expo. Thanks!\n\n## Expo Bundler Spec Compliance\n\nA bundler must follow these requirements if they are to be considered spec compliant for use with a **universal React** (Expo) project.\n\n### Babel Loader\n\nThe babel loading mechanism must include the following properties on its `caller`.\n\n#### platform\n\nA `platform` property denoting the target platform. If the `platform` is not defined, it will default to using `web` when the `bundler` is `webpack` -- this is temporary and will throw an error in the future.\n\n| Value     | Description             |\n| --------- | ----------------------- |\n| `ios`     | Runs on iOS devices     |\n| `android` | Runs on Android devices |\n| `web`     | Runs in web browsers    |\n\n#### bundler\n\nA `bundler` property denoting the name of the bundler that is being used to create the JavaScript bundle.\nIf the `bundler` is not defined, it will default to checking if a `babel-loader` is used, if so then `webpack` will be used, otherwise it will default to `metro`.\n\n| Value     | Description                      |\n| --------- | -------------------------------- |\n| `metro`   | Bundling with [Metro][metro]     |\n| `webpack` | Bundling with [Webpack][webpack] |\n\n[metro]: https://facebook.github.io/metro/\n[webpack]: https://webpack.js.org/\n\n## Options\n\n### [`jsxRuntime`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#runtime)\n\n`classic | automatic`, defaults to `automatic`\n\n- `automatic` automatically convert JSX to JS without the need to `import React from 'react'` in every file. Be sure to follow the rest of the [setup guide](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html#how-to-upgrade-to-the-new-jsx-transform) after enabling this, otherwise ESLint and other tools will throw warnings.\n- `classic` does not automatically import anything, React must imported into every file that uses JSX syntax.\n\n```js\n[\n  'babel-preset-expo',\n  {\n    jsxRuntime: 'classic',\n  },\n];\n```\n\nThis property is passed down to [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This flag does nothing when `native.useTransformReactJSXExperimental` is set to `true` because `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` is omitted.\n\n### [`jsxImportSource`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#importsource)\n\n`string`, defaults to `react`\n\nThis option allows specifying a custom import source for importing functions.\n\n```js\n[\n  'babel-preset-expo',\n  {\n    jsxRuntime: 'automatic',\n    jsxImportSource: 'react',\n  },\n];\n```\n\nThis property is passed down to [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This options does nothing when `jsxRuntime` is not set to `automatic`.\n\n### [`lazyImports`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy)\n\nChanges Babel's compiled `import` statements to be lazily evaluated when their imported bindings are used for the first time.\n\n_Note:_ this option has an effect only when the `disableImportExportTransform` option is set to `false`. On Android and iOS, `disableImportExportTransform` defaults to `false`, and on web it defaults to `true` to allow for tree shaking.\n\nThis can improve the initial load time of your app because evaluating dependencies up front is sometimes entirely un-necessary, particularly when the dependencies have no side effects.\n\nThe value of `lazyImports` has a few possible effects:\n\n- `null` - [metro-react-native-babel-preset](https://github.com/facebook/metro/tree/master/packages/metro-react-native-babel-preset) will handle it. (Learn more about it here: https://github.com/facebook/metro/commit/23e3503dde5f914f3e642ef214f508d0a699851d)\n\n- `false` - No lazy initialization of any imported module.\n\n- `true` - Lazy-init all imported modules except local imports (e.g., `./foo`), certain Expo packages that have side effects, and the two cases mentioned [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy).\n\n- `Array<string>` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.\n\n- `(string) => boolean` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.\n\n  If you choose to do this, you can also access the list of Expo packages that have side effects by using `const lazyImportsBlacklist = require('babel-preset-expo/lazy-imports-blacklist');` which returns a `Set`.\n\n**default:** `null`\n\n```js\n[\n    'babel-preset-expo',\n    {\n        lazyImports: true\n    }\n],\n```\n\n### `web.disableImportExportTransform`\n\nEnabling this option will allow your project to run with older JavaScript syntax (i.e. `module.exports`). This option will break tree shaking and increase your bundle size, but will eliminate the following error when `module.exports` is used:\n\n> `TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'exports' of object '#<Object>'`\n\n**default:** `false` when using Webpack. `true` otherwise.\n\n```js\n[\n    'babel-preset-expo',\n    {\n        web: { disableImportExportTransform: true }\n    }\n],\n```"

Throws an error if the\ninput is invalid.\n\n```js\nvar obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);\n```\n\n### bser.dumpToBuffer\n\nSynchronously encodes a value as BSER.\n\n```js\nvar encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);\nconsole.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']\n```\n\n### BunserBuf\n\nThe asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.\nYou may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the\ndecoded values via its `value` event.\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log(obj);\n});\n```\n\nThen in your socket `data` event:\n\n```js\nbunser.append(buf);\n```\n\n## Example\n\nRead BSER from socket:\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log('data from socket', obj);\n});\n\nvar socket = net.connect('/socket');\n\nsocket.on('data', function(buf) {\n  bunser.append(buf);\n});\n```\n\nWrite BSER to socket:\n\n```js\nsocket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));\n```"

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.",

This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.\n\nIf you're running the code on a browser or node version that doesn't include native promises you will need to include a polyfill.  The following polyfills are tested as part of this module's test suite:-\n- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s [ES6 Promise library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) (which is actually adapted from [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)'s [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)). -  `require('es6-promise').polyfill();`\n- [Getify](https://twitter.com/getify)'s [Native Promise Only library](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - `require('native-promise-only');`\n- [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) - `require('es6-shim');`\n- [Calvin Metcalf](https://twitter.com/CWMma)'s [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - `global.Promise = global.Promise || require('lie');`\n\nNote: as of v1.2.0 you can use **denodeify** in the front end.  Pull it in via CommonJS, AMD or simply add to your webpage and it'll be available on `window.denodeify`. \n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install denodeify --save\n```\n\nOr:-\n\n```\nbower install denodeify --save\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nSimple example with [`readFile`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/read-file):-\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar readFile = denodeify(require('fs').readFile);\n\nreadFile('my-file.txt', { encoding: 'UTF-8' })\n  .then(function(text) {\n    console.log(\"My file's contents is: \" + text);\n  });\n```\n\n(Note: you will need to also install [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) with `npm install es6-promise` for this code sample to work within node versions that don't have `Promise` natively available)\n\nMore complex example with `exec`:-\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nYou can also pass in a function as a second argument of `denodeify` that allows you to manipulate the data returned by the wrapped function before it gets passed to the Promise's `reject` or `resolve` functions, for example:-\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n\n  // Throw away stderr data\n  return [err, stdout];\n});\n\nexec('hostname')\n  .then(function(host) {\n    console.log(\"My hostname is: \" + host.replace('\\n', ''));\n  });\n```\n\nOr,\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  return [err, [stdout, stderr]];\n});\n\nexec('my-command')\n  .then(function(results) {\n    console.log(\"stdout is: \" + results[0]);\n    console.log(\"stderr is: \" + results[1]);\n  });\n```\n\nUseful for functions that return multiple arguments, for example [`child_process#exec`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).\n\n## Credits and collaboration ##\n\nThe lead developer of **denodeify** is [Matt Andrews](http://twitter.com/andrewsmatt) at FT Labs with much help and support from [Kornel Lesiński](https://twitter.com/pornelski). All open source code released by FT Labs is licenced under the MIT licence. We welcome comments, feedback and suggestions.  Please feel free to raise an issue or pull request."

This native code has to be linked into the project and, in some cases, configured further. These actions require some modifications to the native project files. One of the steps that has to be done with the native configuration is to enable the autolinking mechanism that takes care of including any supported module's native code into the project. The following configuration is required:\n\n### iOS\n\n> Caution! After you have made the following changes you will need to run `pod install` again.\n\n```ruby\n# Podfile\n\nrequire File.join(File.dirname(`node --print \"require.resolve('react-native/package.json')\"`), \"scripts/react_native_pods\")\nrequire File.join(File.dirname(`node --print \"require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')\"`), \"cocoapods.rb\")\nrequire File.join(File.dirname(`node --print \"require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')\"`), \"scripts/autolinking\")\n\n#  ...\n\ntarget \"TargetName\" do\n  use_unimodules!\n  config = use_native_modules!\n  use_react_native!(:path => config[\"reactNativePath\"])\n\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\n### Android\n\n```groovy\n// app/build.gradle\n\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../gradle.groovy\")\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('react-native/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../react.gradle\")\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('expo-updates/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../scripts/create-manifest-android.gradle\")\n\n// ...\n\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../native_modules.gradle\");\napplyNativeModulesAppBuildGradle(project)\n```\n\n```groovy\n// settings.gradle\n\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../gradle.groovy\");\nincludeUnimodulesProjects()\n\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../native_modules.gradle\");\napplyNativeModulesSettingsGradle(settings)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe scripts that are referenced in Gradle and Cocoapods are usually found the related package inside the project's `node_modules` directory. In the case of monorepos (such as Yarn workspaces) the project directory may not contain `node_modules` at all; instead, the modules are likely to be located at the root of the repository. In order to ensure that both cases are supported, we take advantage of the Node dependency resolution strategy. We invoke a subprocess that spawns the simple JavaScript snippet that tries to locate the desired npm package containing the script we need.\n\n- On iOS, we use [`` ` ` `` (backtick)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3159945/running-command-line-commands-within-ruby-script) ([alternative reference](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Kernel.html#method-i-60)).\n- On Android, we use [String[]#execute](<http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/lang/String[].html#execute()>) to obtain the results from the subprocess' stdout.\n\nThe Node process that is spawned runs [`require.resolve`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/modules.html#modules_require_resolve_request_options) to obtain the path to a module's `package.json`(if you look for the module location using solely module name, you'll be given the path to the file pointed by the `main` attribute from the `package.json` and we need to know the location of the module's root directory). We then assemble the path to the desired script and execute it.\n\nYou can read more about the scripts and libraries used in the examples above in their official READMEs.\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome!

You can use the following resize modes to obtain behavior as if you were using the React Native `<Image>` component's `resizeMode` style.\n\n#### `CONTAIN` resize mode\n\nScale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions the width and height of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.\n\n<table>\n  <thead><tr><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody><tr>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575867-aeeb3580-c3d6-11eb-825d-19a847fe30f5.mp4\n</td>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575885-b6124380-c3d6-11eb-8485-75a11832962c.mp4\n</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n#### `COVER` resize mode\n\nScale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both the width and height of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.\n\n<table>\n  <thead><tr><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody><tr>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575871-b1e62600-c3d6-11eb-9435-5dee19791294.mp4\n</td>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575890-b7437080-c3d6-11eb-9c0a-3c563d1ee02a.mp4\n</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n#### `NATIVE` resize mode\n\n> **Android only.**\n\nBy using this resize mode your app will will leverage Android's ability to present a static bitmap while the application is starting up.\nAndroid (unlike iOS) does not support stretching of the provided image during launch, so the application will present the given image centered on the screen at its original dimensions.\n\n<table>\n  <thead><tr><td>Android</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody><tr>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575878-b3afe980-c3d6-11eb-80c1-72441c22e8be.mp4\n</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n> Animation above presents one of our [known issues](#native-mode-pushes-splash-image-up-a-little-bit)\n\nSelecting this resize mode requires some more work to be done in native configuration.\nPlease take a look at the [`res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#resdrawablesplashscreenxml) and [`res/drawable/splashscreen_background.png`](#resdrawablesplashscreen_backgroundpng) sections.\n\n### Per-appearance (a.k.a. dark-mode) splash screen\n\n`expo-splash-screen` supports per-appearance splash screens that respond to system appearance changes on iOS 13+ and dark-mode changes on Android 10+.\n\n### StatusBar customization\n\n`expo-splash-screen` allows customization of the StatusBar according to the [ReactNative StatusBar API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar).\n\n## 📚 API\n\n```tsx\nimport * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';\n```\n\nThe native splash screen that is controlled via this module autohides once the ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is mounted. This means that when your app first `render`s view component, the native splash screen will hide. This default behavior can be prevented by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) and later on [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync).\n\n### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`\n\nThis method makes the native splash screen stay visible until [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync) is called. This must be called before any ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is rendered (either in the global scope of your main component, or when the component renders `null` at the beginning - see [Examples section](#-examples)).\n\nPreventing default autohiding might come in handy if your application needs to prepare/download some resources and/or make some API calls before first rendering some actual view hierarchy.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` that resolves to `true` when preventing autohiding succeeded and to `false` if the native splash screen is already prevented from autohiding (for instance, if you've already called this method).\n`Promise` rejection most likely means that native splash screen cannot be prevented from autohiding (it's already hidden when this method was executed).\n\n### `SplashScreen.hideAsync()`\n\nHides the native splash screen. Only works if the native splash screen has been previously prevented from autohiding by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) method.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` that resolves to `true` once the splash screen becomes hidden and to `false` if the splash screen is already hidden.\n\n## 🗒 Examples\n\n### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in global scope\n\n`App.tsx`\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\nimport * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';\n\n// Prevent native splash screen from autohiding before App component declaration\nSplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()\n  .then(result => console.log(`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync() succeeded: ${result}`))\n  .catch(console.warn); // it's good to explicitly catch and inspect any error\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    // Hides native splash screen after 2s\n    setTimeout(async () => {\n      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();\n    }, 2000);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! 👋</Text>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',\n  },\n  text: {\n    color: 'white',\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in component that initially renders `null`\n\n`App.tsx`\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\nimport * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    appIsReady: false,\n  };\n\n  async componentDidMount() {\n    // Prevent native splash screen from autohiding\n    try {\n      await SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.warn(e);\n    }\n    this.prepareResources();\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Method that serves to load resources and make API calls\n   */\n  prepareResources = async () => {\n    await performAPICalls(...);\n    await downloadAssets(...);\n\n    this.setState({ appIsReady: true }, async () => {\n      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (!this.state.appIsReady) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! 👋</Text>\n      </View>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',\n  },\n  text: {\n    color: 'white',\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## 💻 Installation in managed Expo projects\n\nRefer to [the SplashScreen section of the Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/).\n\n## 🖥 Installation in bare React Native projects\n\nFor bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `expo` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.\n\n## Add the package to your dependencies\n\n```\nexpo install expo-splash-screen\n```\n\n## 📱 Configure iOS\n\nRun `npx pod-install` after installing the package.\n\n### Automatic configuration\n\nThe easiest way to configure the splash screen in bare React Native projects is with the expo-splash-screen command. See the [README](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/tree/main/unlinked-packages/configure-splash-screen) for more information, or run `yarn expo-splash-screen --help` in your project.\n\n### Manual Configuration\n\nTo achieve native splash screen (in iOS ecosystem it's called `LaunchScreen`) behavior, you have to provide either a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file or a `SplashScreen.xib` file, and configure your Xcode project accordingly.\n\nThe guide below shows how to configure your Xcode project to use a single image file as a splash screen using a `.storyboard` file (configuration for `.xib` filetype is analogous).\n\n1. [Add an image to `Images.xcassets`](#-add-an-image-to-imagesxcassets)\n2. [Create `SplashScreen.storyboard`](#-create-splashscreenstoryboard)\n3. [Select `Content Mode` for the `ImageView` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`](#-select-content-mode-for-the-imageview-in-splashscreenstoryboard)\n4. [Mark `SplashScreen.storyboard` as the LaunchScreen](#-mark-splashscreenstoryboard-as-the-launchscreen)\n5. [(<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode](#-optional-enable-dark-mode)\n6. [(<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar](#-customize-statusbar)\n\n#### 🛠 Add an image to `Images.xcassets`\n\nFirst you need to add the image file that would serve as a splash screen to your native project's resources.\n\n1. In your Xcode project open the `.xcassets` (often named `Images.xcassets` or `Assets.xcassets`) file.\n2. In the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreen`.\n3. Provide the splash screen image you've prepared (you have to provide it in three different scales).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addImagesXcassets.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n#### 🛠 Create `SplashScreen.storyboard`\n\nThis is the actual splash screen definition and will be used by the system to render your splash screen.\n\n1. Create a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file.\n2. Add a `View Controller` to the newly created `.storyboard` file:\n   - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),\n   - find `View Controller` element,\n   - drag-and-drop it to the `.storyboard` file.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addViewControllerToStoryboard.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n3. Add an `Image View` to the `View Controller`:\n   - first remove other `View` element from `View Controller`,\n   - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),\n   - find `Image View` element,\n   - drag-and-drop it as a `View Controller` child in view hierarchy inspector.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addImageViewToStoryboard.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n4. Set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`:\n   - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Identity Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - and set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addStoryboardID.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n5. Tick `Is Initial View Controller` in `SplashScreenViewController`:\n   - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - and tick `Is Initial View Controller` in View Controller section.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-tickIsInitialViewController.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n6. Configure `Image View` source:\n   - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - select `SplashScreen` in `Image` parameter).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-configureImageView.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n7. Configure `Background` of the `Image View`:\n   - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - configure `Background` parameter:\n     - To enter a `#RRGGBB` value you need to select `Custom` option and in the `Colors Popup` that appeared you need to navigate to the second tab and choose `RGB Sliders` from dropdown select.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-selectBackgroundColor.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n#### 🛠 Select `Content Mode` for the `ImageView` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`\n\nThis is how your image will be displayed on the screen.\n\n1. Open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` from `View Controller`.\n2. Navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and locate `Content Mode`.\n3. Select one of the following:\n   - `Aspect Fit` to obtain [CONTAIN resize mode](#contain-resize-mode),\n   - `Aspect Fill` to obtain [COVER resize mode](#cover-resize-mode).\n4. You can always choose other options to achieve different image positioning and scaling.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-selectImageViewContentMode.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n#### 🛠 Mark `SplashScreen.storyboard` as the LaunchScreen\n\nThe newly created `SplashScreen.storyboard` needs to be marked as the `Launch Screen File` in your Xcode project in order to be presented from the very beginning of your application launch.\n\n1. Select your project in `Project Navigator`\n2. Select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `General` tab.\n3. Locate `App Icons and Launch Images` section and `Launch Screen File` option.\n4. Select or enter `SplashScreen` as the value for located option.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-selectLaunchScreen.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode\n\n##### Provide different background colors\n\nDepending on what iOS version your application is targeting, you have to adjust your native project differently to a obtain working per-appearance splash screen view.\n\n##### I'm targeting iOS 11+\n\nYou can take advantage of [`named colors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html) in your Xcode project.\n\n1. Create a new `Color Set` and customize its values for different color modes:\n   - in your `.xcassets` directory (either create a new `.xcassets` for colors, or reuse an existing one e.g. with images) create `New Color Set` and name it `SplashScreenBackground`,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and change `Appearance` to `Any, Dark`,\n   - select desired color in `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel for each mode.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-createNamedColor.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n2. Select created `named color` as the `Background` for the `Image View` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`:\n   - open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - configure `Background` parameter by selecting your created `named color` (that should be listed as `SplashScreenBackground`).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-selectNamedColor.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n##### I'm targeting iOS version < 11\n\nYou cannot use [`named colors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html) feature in your Xcode project.\nInstead you have to create an additional image set that contains small 1x1px images, each with the desired background color. Then, you'll use this additional image resource as a background in the splash screen view.\n\nYou can use this online generator to obtain 1x1px `.png` images with desired colors: http://www.1x1px.me.\n\n1. Create `SplashScreenBackground` `Image Set` with desired background colors for each mode in your `Images.xcassets` directory:\n   - open your `.xcassets` directory with images,\n   - in the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreenBackground`,\n   - convert this `Image set` to support `Dark Appearance` by navigating to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and changing `Appearance` to `Any, Dark`,\n   - provide images with colors for every mode (you can generate color 1x1px images using http://www.1x1px.me).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addSplashScreenBackgroundImages.png\" height=\"250\" />\n</details>\n\n2. Update `SplashScreen.storyboard` to consist of a single top-level `View` with two `Image View` subviews (solid-colored image in the background and actual splash screen image in the foreground):\n\n   - open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and replace `Image View` with a plain `View` (search `Library` for it and drag&drop it in place of current `Image View`),\n   - add two\n\n3. Configure first `Image View` (background color):\n   - configure attributes in `Attributes Inspector`:\n     - set `Image` to `SplashScreenBackground` (prepared in previous step),\n     - set `Content Mode` to `Scale To Fill` (color needs to take all available space),\n   - make this subview take all available space in parent view:\n     - open `Add new constraints` bottom menu,\n     - make sure `Constrain to margin` is not checked,\n     - for every input, open the dropdown and select `View` (parent view reference) and set `0` as the value,\n     - once every side is covered (`0` value and parent view reference selected in dropdown) hit `Add 4 Constraints`,\n     - observe that in `View Hierarchy Inspector` constraints are added and `Image View` resized to take whole place of parent view.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-createBackgroundImageView.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n4. Configure second `Image View` (actual splash screen image):\n   - select second `Image View` and select correct `Image` in `Attributes Inspector` alongside with desired `Content Mode`,\n   - make this subview take all available space in parent view (see previous step).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addConstraintsToImageViews.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n##### Provide different splash screen image\n\nYou might want to add a separate image for `dark` mode. If the system is switched to `dark` mode, it would pick this different image instead of the normal one and present it in the splash screen view.\n\n1. In your Xcode project open `SplashScreen` (created in previous section).\n2. Convert this asset to support `Dark Appearance`:\n\n- navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n- locate `Appearances` section and select `Any, Dark`,\n- provide image for `dark mode` by dropping it to the correct box.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addDarkImagesXcassets.png\" height=\"280\" />\n</details>\n\n###### Background color when you want to support iOS < 11\n\nIf you're targeting a version of iOS < 11 then you cannot use `named color` feature and instead you need to generate images with desired background colors that are going to be used as the background for splash screen view.\nThere is this awesome 1x1px png online generator: http://www.1x1px.me (use it to generate two 1x1px images with desired background colors for different color modes).\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar\n\nYou might want to customize the StatusBar appearance during the time the SplashScreen is being shown.\n\n1. Customize `StatusBar hiding` flag:\n\n- open main project view, select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `Info` tab,\n- add or modify `Status bar initially hidden` attribute with desired value.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-statusBar-hidden.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n2. Customize `StatusBar style` option:\n\n- open main project view, select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `Info` tab,\n- add or modify `Status bar style` attribute with desired value.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-statusBar-style.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n## 🤖 Configure Android\n\nTo achieve fully-native splash screen behavior, `expo-splash-screen` needs to be hooked into the native view hierarchy and consume some resources that have to be placed under `/android/app/src/res` directory.\n\n### Automatic configuration\n\nThe easiest way to configure the splash screen in bare React Native projects is with the expo-splash-screen command. See the [README](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/tree/main/unlinked-packages/configure-splash-screen) for more information, or run `yarn expo-splash-screen --help` in your project.\n\n### Manual Configuration\n\n1. [Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`](#-configure-resdrawablesplashscreen_imagepng)\n2. [Configure `res/values/colors.xml`](#-configure-resvaluescolorsxml)\n3. [Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#-configure-resdrawablesplashscreenxml)\n4. [Configure `res/values/styles.xml`](#-configure-resvaluesstylesxml)\n5. [Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`](#-configure-androidmanifestxml)\n6. [(<em>optional</em>) Customzine `resizeMode`](#-optional-customize-resizemode)\n7. [(<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode](#-optional-enable-dark-mode-1)\n8. [(<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar](#-customize-statusbar-1)\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`\n\nYou have to provide your splash screen image and place it under the `res/drawable` directory.\nThis image will be loaded as soon as Android mounts your application's native view hierarchy.\n\n##### `NATIVE` mode adjustments\n\nIf you've overridden `<string name=\"expo_splash_screen_resize_mode\">native</string>` mode in [`res/values/strings.xml`](#-optional-customize-resizemode), you need to do a few additional steps.\n\nIn your application's `res` directory you might want to have a number of `drawable-X` sub-directories (where `X` is the different DPI for different devices). They store different versions of images that are picked based on the device's DPI (for more information please see [this official Android docs](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskProvideAltBmp)).\n\nTo achieve proper scaling of your splash screen image on every device you should have following directories:\n\n- `res/drawable-mdpi` - scale 1x - resources for medium-density (mdpi) screens (~160dpi). (This is the baseline density.)\n- `res/drawable-hdpi` - scale 1.5x - resources for high-density (hdpi) screens (~240dpi).\n- `res/drawable-xhdpi` - scale 2x - resources for extra-high-density (xhdpi) screens (~320dpi).\n- `res/drawable-xxhdpi` - scale 3x - resources for extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi) screens (~480dpi).\n- `res/drawable-xxxhdpi` - scale 4x - resources for extra-extra-extra-high-density (xxxhdpi) uses (~640dpi).\n\nEach of directories mentioned above should contain the same `splashscreen_image.png` file, but with a different resolution (pay attention to scale factors).\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `res/values/colors.xml`\n\nThis file contains colors that are reused across your application at the native level.\nUpdate the file with the following content or create one if missing:\n\n```diff\n<resources>\n+ <color name=\"splashscreen_background\">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->\n  <!-- Other colors defined for your application -->\n</resources>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`\n\nThis file contains the description of how the splash screen view should be drawn by the Android system.\nCreate the file with the following content:\n\n```diff\n+ <layer-list xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\n+   <item android:drawable=\"@color/splashscreen_background\"/>\n+ </layer-list>\n```\n\n#### `NATIVE` mode adjustments\n\nIf you've overridden `<string name=\"expo_splash_screen_resize_mode\">native</string>` mode in [`res/values/strings.xml`](#-optional-customize-resizemode), you shoulw add:\n\n```diff\n<layer-list xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\n  <item android:drawable=\"@color/splashscreen_background\"/>\n+ <item>\n+   <bitmap android:gravity=\"center\" android:src=\"@drawable/splashscreen_image\"/>\n+ </item>\n</layer-list>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `res/values/styles.xml`\n\nLocate your main activity theme in `/android/app/src/res/values/styles.xml` or create one if missing.\n\n```diff\n  <!-- Main activity theme. -->\n  <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n+   <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@drawable/splashscreen</item> <!-- this line instructs the system to use 'splashscreen.xml' as a background of the whole application -->\n    <!-- Other style properties -->\n  </style>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`\n\nAdjust your application's main `AndroidManifest.xml` to contain an `android:theme` property pointing to the style that contains your splash screen configuration:\n\n```diff\n<manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    package=\"com.example.myapp\">\n\n  ...\n\n  <application ...>\n\n+   <!-- Ensure that 'android:theme' property is pointing to the style containing native splash screen reference - see 'styles.xml' -->\n    <activity\n      android:name=\".MainActivity\"\n+     android:theme=\"@style/AppTheme\"\n      ...\n    >\n      ...\n    </activity>\n  </application>\n\n</manifest>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize `resizeMode`\n\nThe default image [`resizeMode`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/%40kudo/modularize-expo-splash-screen/packages/expo-splash-screen#built-in-splash-screen-image-resize-modes) is [`CONTAIN`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/%40kudo/modularize-expo-splash-screen/packages/expo-splash-screen#contain-resize-mode). If you want to have different `resizeMode`, you need to override in `res/values/strings.xml`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n <resources>\n   <string name=\"app_name\">sdk42</string>\n+  <string name=\"expo_splash_screen_resize_mode\">contain|cover|native</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode\n\n##### Provide different background colors - `res/values-night/colors.png`\n\nIf you want to have different background colors in your splash screen depending on the system color mode, you need to create a similar file to `colors.xml`, but in the directory `res/values-night`.\nValues in this file are going to picked by the system when it is switched to `dark` mode.\n\n```diff\n<resources>\n+ <color name=\"splashscreen_background\">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->\n</resources>\n```\n\n##### Provide different splash screen image - `res/drawable-night/splashscreen_image.png`\n\nYou might want to provide a separate splash screen image for dark mode usage, and place it under the `res/drawable-night` directory with exactly the same name as the normal one.\nThis step is optional, because you might want to have the same image in both `light` and `dark` modes (e.g. you have just a light-themed logo and you want to have different background colors in different modes).\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar\n\nYou might want to customize the StatusBar appearance during the time the SplashScreen is being shown.\n\n1. Customize `StatusBar hiding` flag\n\nTo have the StatusBar completely hidden you need to update your `res/values/styles.xml` file with the following entry (to prevent StatusBar from hiding either remove this entry or enter `false` as the value):\n\n```diff\n  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->\n  <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n    <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@drawable/splashscreen</item>\n+   <item name=\"android:windowFullscreen\">true</item>\n    <!-- Other style properties -->\n  </style>\n```\n\nIf you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night`, `res/values-night-v23`, etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.\n\nRead more about `android:windowFullscreen` flag in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowFullscreen).\n\n2. Customize `StatusBar style` option\n\nThis option is only available for Android devices running Android 6.0 or greater.\nTo enforce `light` or `dark` StatusBar style for given system color mode, you have to prepare or update your `res/values-v23/styles.xml` file with the following entry (as of this option being supported since API 23, you have to configure specifically named directory containing separate configuration files):\n\n```diff\n  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->\n  <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n    <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@drawable/splashscreen</item>\n+   <item name=\"android:windowLightStatusBar\">true|false</item>\n    <!-- Other style properties -->\n  </style>\n```\n\nAvailable values:\n\n- `true` for having dark-colored icons,\n- `false` for having light-colored icons.\n\nIf you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night-v23` (for dark color mode), etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.\n\nRead more about `android:windowLightStatusBar` flag in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowLightStatusBar).\n\nTo read more about Android multi-API-level support see [this official documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources).\n\n3. Customize `StatusBar color` option (a.k.a. `background color` of the StatusBar component)\n\nTo achieve custom background color you need to create a new color resource and provide it to the SplashScreen `style` description.\n\nCreate new color resource in your `res/values/colors.xml` (if your application supports dark mode, consider adding different color in `res/values-night/colors.xml` file):\n\n```diff\n  <resources>\n    <!-- Below line is handled by '@expo/configure-splash-screen' command and it's discouraged to modify it manually -->\n    <color name=\"splashscreen_background\">#D0D0C0</color>\n+   <color name=\"splashscreen_statusbar_color\">#(AA)RRGGBB</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->\n  </resources>\n```\n\nUpdate your `res/values/styles.xml` file with the following entry:\n\n```diff\n  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->\n  <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n    <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@drawable/splashscreen</item>\n+   <item name=\"android:statusBarColor\">@color/splashscreen_statusbar_color</item>\n    <!-- Other style properties -->\n  </style>\n```\n\nIf you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night`, `res/values-night-v23`, etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.\n\nRead more about `android:statusBarColor` option in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#statusBarColor).\n\n4. Customize `StatusBar translucent` flag\n\nWhen the StatusBar is translucent, the app will be able to draw under the StatusBar component area.\n\nTo make the StatusBar translucent update your `res/values/strings.xml` file with the following content:\n\n```diff\n--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n <resources>\n   <string name=\"app_name\">sdk42</string>\n+  <string name=\"expo_splash_screen_status_bar_translucent\">true</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n## 👏 Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome! Please refer to guidelines described in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/expo/expo#contributing).\n\n## ❓ Known issues\n\n### iOS caching\n\nSplash Screens on iOS apps can sometimes encounter a caching issue where the previous image will flash before showing the new, intended image. When this occurs, we recommend you try power cycling your device and uninstalling and re-installing the application. However, the caching sometimes can persist for a day or two so be patient if the aforementioned steps were unable to resolve the issue.\n\n### `NATIVE` mode pushes splash image up a little bit\n\nSee [`NATIVE`](#native-resize-mode) mode preview above.\n\n> We are aware of this issue and unfortunately haven't been able to provide a solution as of yet. This is on our immediate roadmap...\n\n## ⬆️ Migrate from old versions\n\n### Migrate from expo-splash-screen < 0.12.0\n\nWe try to keep changes backward compatible, the code for `expo-splash-screen` will still work as it used to be. However, if you are going to migrate as new style API, here are the steps:\n\n1. Migrate your project from react-native-unimodules to expo-modules-core\n2. Remove expo-splash-screen code from MainActivity\n\n```diff\n--- a/android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/MainActivity.java\n+++ b/android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/MainActivity.java\n import com.facebook.react.ReactRootView;\n import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView;\n\n-import expo.modules.splashscreen.singletons.SplashScreen;\n-import expo.modules.splashscreen.SplashScreenImageResizeMode;\n-\n public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {\n   @Override\n   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n     // This is required for expo-splash-screen.\n     setTheme(R.style.AppTheme);\n     super.onCreate(null);\n-    // SplashScreen.show(...) has to be called after super.onCreate(...)\n-    // Below line is handled by '@expo/configure-splash-screen' command and it's discouraged to modify it manually\n-    SplashScreen.show(this, SplashScreenImageResizeMode.CONTAIN, ReactRootView.class, false);\n   }\n```\n\n3. Override default `resizeMode` and `statusBarTranslucent` in stings.xml\n\n```diff\n--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n <resources>\n   <string name=\"app_name\">sdk42</string>\n+  <string name=\"expo_splash_screen_resize_mode\">contain</string>\n+  <string name=\"expo_splash_screen_status_bar_translucent\">false</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n## 🏅 Hall Of Fame\n\nThis module is based on a solid work from (many thanks for that 👏):\n\n- [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen)\n- [react-native-bootsplash](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-bootsplash)\n- [react-native-make](https://github.com/bamlab/react-native-make)"

    "licenseText": "# The flow-parser package\n\nThis package contains the Flow parser in its compiled-to-JavaScript form.\n\n# What is Flow\n\nSee [flow.org](https://flow.org/). The code for the Flow parser [lives on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/flow/tree/master/src/parser).\n\n# What is the Flow Parser\n\nThe Flow Parser is a JavaScript parser written in OCaml. It produces an AST that conforms to the [ESTree spec](https://github.com/estree/estree) and that mostly matches what [esprima](http://esprima.org/) produces. The Flow Parser can be compiled to native code or can be compiled to JavaScript using [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/). This npm package contains the Flow parser compiled to JavaScript.\n\n# Usage\n\nYou can use the Flow parser in your browser or in node. To use in node you can just do\n\n```JavaScript\nrequire('flow-parser').parse('1+1', {});\n```\n\nTo use in the browser, you can add\n\n```HTML\n<script src=\"flow_parser.js\"></script>\n```\n\nwhich will make the `flow` object available to use like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nflow.parse('1+1', {});\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThe second argument to `flow.parse` is the options object. Currently supported options:\n\n* `enums` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of Flow enums\n* `esproposal_decorators` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of decorators\n* `esproposal_class_instance_fields` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of class instance fields\n* `esproposal_class_static_fields` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of class static fields\n* `esproposal_export_star_as` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of `export * as` syntax\n* `esproposal_optional_chaining` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of optional chaining (`?.`)\n* `esproposal_nullish_coalescing` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of nullish coalescing (`??`)\n* `types` (boolean, default `true`) - enable parsing of Flow types"

    "name": "imurmurhash",
    "version": "0.1.4",
    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Nothing\r\nelse but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)\r\ngrants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work\r\nor to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt\r\nto do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement\r\nbetween Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the\r\nequivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by\r\nexercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate\r\nYour acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically\r\nand You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License\r\nas of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\r\nagainst Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a\r\npatent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging\r\npatent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or\r\nhardware.\r\n\r\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\r\nLicense may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\r\nLicensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\r\nthe laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\r\napplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\r\nSale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the\r\nscope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the\r\nrequirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et\r\nseq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This\r\nsection shall survive the termination of this License.\r\n\r\n12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or\r\nseeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\r\nrecover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\r\nattorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including\r\nany appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning\r\nthe subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\r\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to\r\nmake it enforceable.\r\n\r\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License, whether\r\nin upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights\r\nunder, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal\r\nentities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is\r\nunder common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means\r\n(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such\r\nentity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent\r\n(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such\r\nentity.\r\n\r\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise\r\nrestricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not\r\nto interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\r\n\r\nThis license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved.\r\nPermission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without\r\nmodification. This license may not be modified without the express written\r\npermission of its copyright owner."

These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\n  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or\n  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\n  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation\n  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer\n  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions\n  or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\n  d.

React Native itself uses this Babel preset by default when transforming your app's source code.\n\nIf you wish to use a custom Babel configuration by writing a `babel.config.js` file in your project's root directory, you must specify all the plugins necessary to transform your code. React Native does not apply its default Babel configuration in this case. So, to make your life easier, you can use this preset to get the default configuration and then specify more plugins that run before it.\n\n## Usage\n\nAs mentioned above, you only need to use this preset if you are writing a custom `babel.config.js` file.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall `metro-react-native-babel-preset` in your app:\n\nwith `npm`:\n\n```sh\nnpm i metro-react-native-babel-preset --save-dev\n```\n\nor with `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add -D metro-react-native-babel-preset\n```\n\n### Configuring Babel\n\nThen, create a file called `babel.config.js` in your project's root directory. The existence of this `babel.config.js` file will tell React Native to use your custom Babel configuration instead of its own. Then load this preset:\n\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"module:metro-react-native-babel-preset\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can further customize your Babel configuration by specifying plugins and other options. See [Babel's `babel.config.js` documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files/) to learn more.\n\n## Help and Support\n\nIf you get stuck configuring Babel, please ask a question on Stack Overflow or find a consultant for help. If you discover a bug, please open up an issue."

See [react-native#13976](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13976) for the initial announcement."

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."

It does turn out if you ask \"why _not_?!\" once in a while something fun happens."

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

    "licenseText": "# `react-devtools-core`\n\nA standalone React DevTools implementation.\n\nThis is a low-level package. If you're looking for the Electron app you can run, **use `react-devtools` package instead.**\n\n## API\n\n### `react-devtools-core`\n\nThis is similar requiring the `react-devtools` package, but provides several configurable options. Unlike `react-devtools`, requiring `react-devtools-core` doesn't connect immediately but instead exports a function:\n\n```js\nconst { connectToDevTools } = require(\"react-devtools-core\");\nconnectToDevTools(config);\n```\n\nRun `connectToDevTools()` in the same context as React to set up a connection to DevTools.  \nBe sure to run this function *before* importing e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, `react-native`.\n\nThe `config` object may contain:\n* `host: string` (defaults to \"localhost\") - Websocket will connect to this host.\n* `port: number` (defaults to `8097`) - Websocket will connect to this port.\n* `useHttps: boolean` (defaults to `false`) - Websocket should use a secure protocol (wss).\n* `websocket: Websocket` - Custom websocket to use. Overrides `host` and `port` settings if provided.\n* `resolveRNStyle: (style: number) => ?Object` - Used by the React Native style plug-in.\n* `retryConnectionDelay: number` (defaults to `2000`) - Milliseconds delay to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection.\n* `isAppActive: () => boolean` - If provided, DevTools will poll this method and wait until it returns true before connecting to React.\n\n## `react-devtools-core/standalone`\n\nRenders the DevTools interface into a DOM node.\n\n```js\nrequire(\"react-devtools-core/standalone\")\n  .setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById(\"container\"))\n  .setStatusListener(status => {\n    // This callback is optional...\n  })\n  .startServer(port);\n```\n\nRenders DevTools interface into a DOM node over SSL using a custom host name (Default is localhost).\n\n```js\nconst host = 'dev.server.com';\nconst options = {\n  key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),\n  cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')\n};\n\n\nrequire(\"react-devtools-core/standalone\")\n  .setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById(\"container\"))\n  .setStatusListener(status => {\n    // This callback is optional...\n  })\n  .startServer(port, host, options);\n```\n\nReference the `react-devtools` package for a complete integration example.\n\n## Development\n\nWatch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:backend\n```\n\nWatch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:standalone\n```"

Please use linebyline instead, it is the same module just renamed:\n[Npm linebyline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linebyline)\n\n```sh\nnpm install linebyline\n```\n\n## Test\n```sh\nnpm install .\nnpm test\n\n```\n\n\n## What's this?\n\nSimple streaming readline module for NodeJS. Reads a file and buffers new lines emitting a _line_ event for each line.\n\n## Usage\n### Simple\n```js\n  var readline = require('linebyline'),\n      rl = readline('./somefile.txt');\n  rl.on('line', function(line, lineCount, byteCount) {\n    // do something with the line of text\n  })\n  .on('error', function(e) {\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n```\n\n### ASCII file decoding\nAs the underlying `fs.createReadStream` doesn't care about the specific ASCII encoding of the file, an alternative way to decode the file is by telling the `readline` library to retain buffer and then decoding it using a converter (e.g. [`iconv-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconv-lite)).\n```js\n  var readline = require('linebyline'),\n      rl = readline('./file-in-win1251.txt', {\n    retainBuffer: true //tell readline to retain buffer \n  });\n  rl.on(\"line\", function (data,linecount){\n    var line = iconv.decode(data, 'win1251');\n    // do something with the line of converted text\n  });\n```\n##API\n## readLine(readingObject[, options])\n### Params:\n\n* `readingObject` - file path or stream object\n* `options` can include:\n  * `maxLineLength` - override the default 4K buffer size (lines longer than this will not be read)\n  * `retainBuffer` - avoid converting to String prior to emitting 'line' event; will pass raw buffer with encoded data to the callback\n\n### Return:\n\n* **EventEmitter** \n\n\n## License\n\nBSD © [Craig Brookes](http://craigbrookes.com/)"

    "licenseText": "# Safe JSON Stringify\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/debitoor/safe-json-stringify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/debitoor/safe-json-stringify)\n[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/safe-json-stringify.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-json-stringify)\n\nA wrapper for `JSON.stringify` that handles circular references and prevents defined getters from throwing errors.\n\nCircular references are handled by returning `[Circular]` when a circular reference is spotted.\n\nDefined getters that throw errors are handled by returning `[Throws]`.\n\nUsage\n-----\nInstall it using NPM\n\n```sh\nnpm install safe-json-stringify\n```\n\nAnd require it into your Node project.\n\n```js\nconst safeJsonStringify = require('safe-json-stringify');\nconst data = {foo: 'bar'}\n\nconsole.log(safeJsonStringify(data));\n```\n\nAll the parameters of `JSON.stringify` are accepted, try e.g. the following for a nicely formatted output:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(safeJsonStringify(data, null, 2));\n```\n\nAn `ensureProperties` function is exposed too, which returns a safe object without the stringify step. Usage: `safeJsonStringify.ensureProperties(data);`.\n\n\nWhy?\n----\nThe `stringify` function on the JavaScript JSON object will take any data and return a string representation of said data. If this data contains an object literal it will attempt to return the values of any enumerable property set on this object. This can be dangerous because JavaScript supports a couple of ways to define property getters on objects.\n\nThe old, non-standard, and now deprecated `Object.prototype.__defineGetter__()` will define a named property which value is the return of a given function.\n\n```js\n// Never ever do this in your code. Please.\nvar obj = {};\nobj.__defineGetter__('foo', function() { return 'bar'; });\n\nJSON.stringify(obj); // {\"foo\":\"bar\"}\n```\n\nThis is kinda bad because we could make that function throw an error.\n\n```js\n// Never ever do this in your code. Please.\nvar obj = {};\nobj.__defineGetter__('foo', function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); });\n\nJSON.stringify(obj); // error thrown\n```\n\nThis property is created as an enumerable on the object, so the object from the previous example would make any function that iterates choke and throw an error. This is bad because one would never expect a simple property get to throw an error and bring down a system.\n\n`JSON.stringify` will blindly trust any object property, and will throw an error if it hits a defined property that throws an error. This could potentially take down your program.\n\nThe slightly better `Object.defineProperty()` does the same thing, but has the common courtesy to not define the getter as enumerable--that is per default. The following example would bring us in the same situation as with `__defineGetter__`.\n\n```js\n// Never ever do this in your code. Please.\nvar obj = {};\nObject.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', {\n    get: function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); },\n        enumerable: true // enumerable is false by default\n});\n\nJSON.stringify(obj); // error thrown\n```\n\nSo, we can not trust any of them. One could argue that they should never be used, and we can, and should, apply that principle to our own software, but we cannot trust code from third-party modules. If data from third-party modules are to be stringified by JSON we should take these situations into considerations. This module attempt to do that by spotting defined getters and return \"[Throws]\" if said getter throws an error.\n\n```js\nvar safeJsonStringify = require('safe-json-stringify');\n// Never ever do this in your code. Please.\nvar obj = {};\nObject.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', {\n    get: function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); },\n        enumerable: true\n});\n\nsafeJsonStringify(obj); // '{\"foo\":\"[Throws]\"}'\n```\n\nAnd it attempts to handle circular references too. It returns \"[Circular]\" if it spots one.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014-2017 [Debitoor](https://debitoor.com/)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "licenseText": "# Node Stream Buffers\r\n\r\n[![Build Status][badge-travis-img]][badge-travis-url]\r\n[![Code Climate][badge-climate-img]][badge-climate-url]\r\n[![Code Coverage][badge-coverage-img]][badge-coverage-url]\r\n\r\nSimple Readable and Writable Streams that use a [Buffer][node-buffer-docs] to store received data, or for data to send out. Useful for test code, debugging, and a wide range of other utilities.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n[![NPM][badge-npm-img]][badge-npm-url]\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use the stream buffers in your module, simply import it and away you go.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar streamBuffers = require(\"stream-buffers\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Writable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nWritable Stream Buffers implement the standardized writable stream interface. All write()'s to this object will accumulate in an internal Buffer. If the Buffer overflows it will be resized larger automatically. The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tinitialSize: (100 * 1024),\t\t// start as 100 kilobytes.\r\n\tincrementAmount: (10 * 1024)\t// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE \t\t// (8 * 1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT\t// (8 * 1024)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWriting is standard Stream stuff:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer);\r\n// - or -\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nstreamBuffers.size();\t\t\t// 4.\r\nstreamBuffers.maxSize();\t\t// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024).\r\n```\r\n\r\nRetrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t\t\t\t// Gets all held data as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\");\t\t// Gets all held data as a utf8 string.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);\t\t\t\t\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\", 5);\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCare should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).\r\n \r\nDestroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();\r\n\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t// Returns ASDF in Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"Yeah?\");\t\t// No effect.\r\n```\t\r\n\r\n### Readable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nReadable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out. \r\n\r\nThe frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tfrequency: 10,\t\t// in milliseconds.\r\n\tchunkSize: 2048\t\t// in bytes.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefault frequency and chunk size:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE \t\t// (1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY\t\t\t// (1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPutting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer);\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\t// Yup.\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing. \r\n\r\nsetEncoding() for streams is respected too:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding(\"utf8\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof String);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again. \r\n\r\nDestroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon();\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String!\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.size();\t\t\t// will be 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nNot supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThanks to the following people for taking some time to contribute to this project.\r\n\r\n * Igor Dralyuk <idralyuk@ebay.com>\r\n * Simon Koudijs <simon.koudijs@intellifi.nl>\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nnode-stream-buffer is free and unencumbered public domain software.

    "licenseText": "Structured Headers parser for Javascript\n========================================\n\nThis library is a parser and serializer for the [Structured Headers][1]\nspecification, a.k.a. \"Structured Field Values for HTTP\" (RFC8941).\n\nThis specification defines a standard serialization for complex HTTP header\nvalues, including lists (arrays), dictionaries (maps) and also numbers,\nbooleans, and binary data.\n\nThe library is written in Typescript, and the examples in this document are\ntoo, but plain Javascript is also fully supported.\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nThis package has 2725 unittests, the vast majority are supplied from the\nofficial [HTTP WG test suite][2].\n\nHowever, there are 2 differences in the serializer:\n\n1. Javascript can't differentiate between `1.0` and `1`. As a result we're\n   skipping the tests that require a serialiation output of `1.0`.\n2. Javascript rounds slightly different from the spec. The tests suggest that\n   `0.0025` should round to the nearest event number (`0.002`), but Javascript\n   rounds to `0.003`.\n\nNo fix is planned for #1, because there's no reasonably way to fix this\nwithout wrapping every number in a custom class, and this will negatively\nimpact the developer experience. We do intend to fix #2 in the future with a\ncustom rounding algorithm.\n\nThis library emits and expects the _exact_ data structures as they are\nsuggested by the RFC. The result of this is that the returned types can be\na bit complex.\n\nIn the future we intend to loosen the required types for the serializer, and\nadd new helper functions that give you simpler structures _if_ you don't need\ncertain features for a header (such as `Parameters`).\n\nLet us know what you would like to see here!\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUsing npm:\n\n```\nnpm install structured-headers\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### Parsing an item\n\nThe following are examples of `item` headers:\n\nParsed as string\n\n```\n# Parsed as string\nHeader: \"foo\"\n\n# A simple string, called a 'Token' in the spec\nHeader: foo\n\n# Parsed as number\nHeader: 5\nHeader: -10\nHeader: 5.01415\n\n# Parsed into boolean\nHeader: ?1\nHeader: ?0\n\n# Binaries are base64 encoded\nHeader: :RE0gbWUgZm9yIGEgZnJlZSBjb29raWU=:\n\n# Items can have parameters\nHeader: \"Hello world\"; a=\"5\"\n```\n\n\nTo parse these header values, use the `parseItem`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { parseItem } from 'structured-headers';\n\nconsole.log(\n  parseItem(header)\n);\n```\n\nparseItem returns a tuple (array with 2 items), the first item is the value,\nthe second is a `Map` object with parameters.\n\nThe type is roughly:\n\n```typescript\n\n// The raw value\ntype BareItem = number | string | Token | ByteSequence | boolean;\n\n// The return type of parseItem\ntype Item = [\n  BareItem,\n  Map<string, BareItem>\n];\n```\n\n### Parsing a list\n\nA list is an array of items. Some examples:\n\n```\n# A simple list\nHeader: 5, \"foo\", bar, ?1\n\n# Each element can have parameters\nHeader: sometoken; param1; param2=hi, 42\n\n# A list can also contain lists itself. These are called 'inner lists' and\n# use parenthesis\nHeader: sometoken, (innerlistitem1 innerlistitem2), (anotherlist)\n```\n\n\nTo parse these:\n\n```typescript\nimport { parseList } from 'structured-headers';\n\nconsole.log(\n  parseList(header)\n);\n```\n\n`parseList` returns an array with each member. The return type is:\n\n```typescript\ntype InnerList = [Item[], Parameters];\ntype List = (InnerList|Item)[];\n```\n\n### Parsing a dictionary\n\nA dictionary is a key->value object. Examples:\n\n```\n# A simple dictionary\nHeader: fn=\"evert\", ln=\"pot\", coffee=?1\n\n# Each item may have parameters too\nHeader: foo=123; q=1, bar=123, q=0.5\n\n# A dictionary value may be an inner list again\nHeader: foo=(1 2 3)\n```\n\nTo parse dictionaries:\n\n```typescript\nimport { parseDictionary } from 'structured-headers';\n\nconsole.log(\n  parseDictionary(header)\n);\n```\n\nThe return type for `parseDictionary` is a `Map`.\n\n```typescript\ntype Dictionary = Map<string, Item|InnerList>;\n```\n\n\n### Serializing\n\nThe serialiser functions work the exact same way, but in opposite direction.\nThey all return strings.\n\nCurrently the serializes expect the *exact type* that the parsers return, but\nthe intention is to loosen the types for serialization, so it's a bit more\nergnomic to call. Want this? Let me know by opening an issue.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n  serializeDictionary,\n  serializeList,\n  serializeItem\n} from 'structured-headers';\n\n\n// Returns \"foo\", \"bar\"\nserializeList([\n  ['foo', new Map()],\n  ['bar', new Map()],\n]);\n\n// Returns a=1, b=?0\nsh.serializeDictionary(new Map([\n  ['a', [1, new Map()]],\n  ['b', [false, new Map()]],\n]));\n\n// Returns 42\nserializeItem([42, new Map()]);\n\n// Returns 5.5\nserializeItem([5.5, new Map()]);\n\n// Returns \"hello world\"\nserializeItem([\"hello world\", new Map()]);\n\n// Returns ?1\nserializeItem([true, new Map()]);\n\n// Returns a base-64 representation like: *aGVsbG8=*\nserializeItem([new ByteSequence('aGVsbG8='), new Map()]);\n```\n\nBrowser support\n---------------\n\nThere is a minified version of this library in the `browser/` directory. This minified\nfile will expose a global variable called 'structuredHeader' which contains the rest\nof the api.\n\n\n[1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8941\n[2]: https://github.com/httpwg/structured-field-tests"

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.",
